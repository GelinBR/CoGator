Students procrastinate, we all know that. Procrastination, the art of waiting to do things at the last minute, is both harmful to one's mental health and personal goals and academic performance. Time management plays a key role in procrastination. But there are barriers of ease and effort when it comes to time management. Co-Gator is intended to serve as a personal secretary and assistant manager for your academic life. It will read and analyze your course syllabi, assignment instructions and deadlines, generate expected timeframes, break down complex tasks into simpler ones, and space things out at your convenience. Communication directly with the LLM and optional Calendar integration will allow your academic life to fit around YOUR schedule, not the other way around. Have a date at that time? Don't want to work on your birthday? Or just want to take a day off? Co-Gator will make the adjustments you need while dynamically updating deadlines and requirements to make sure you can still deliver.
